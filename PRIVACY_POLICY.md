# Privacy Policy for Planszowsky

**Last updated: February 06, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes our policies and procedures on the collection, use, and disclosure of your information when you use the Planszowsky mobile application.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

Planszowsky is designed to help you manage your board game collection. We value your privacy and aim to collect only the minimum necessary data to provide our features.

### Personal Data
We do not require you to create an account with us. However, if you use the BoardGameGeek (BGG) import feature, we process the BGG username you provide to fetch your public collection data.

### Camera Access
The application requires access to your device's camera to:
- Scan barcodes (EAN/UPC) to quickly identify board games.
- Use Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to identify games by the text on their boxes.
Images processed by the camera are analyzed locally on your device and are not stored or transmitted to our servers.

### Expert AI (Gemini)
The "Ask the Expert" feature uses Google's Gemini AI. When you chat with the expert, your messages and the title of the game you are inquiring about are sent to Google's servers to generate a response. Please do not share sensitive personal information in the chat.

## 2. Third-Party Services

The application uses several third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:

- **BoardGameGeek (BGG):** Used as a data source for board game information. When you search for or import games, requests are sent to BGG's servers. Their privacy policy applies to their service.
- **Firebase (Google):**
    - **Crashlytics:** We use Crashlytics to monitor application stability and fix bugs. It collects anonymous crash reports.
    - **Analytics:** We use Firebase Analytics to understand how users interact with the app to improve the user experience.
- **Google Play Services:** Used for various system integrations.

## 3. Data Storage
Most of your data (your collection, wishlist, borrowing history) is stored locally on your device in a private database. If you uninstall the application, this local data will be deleted.

## 4. Children's Privacy
Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.

## 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.
